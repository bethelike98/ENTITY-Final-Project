# Twitter Sentiment NLP Classifier
A repository containing my code and images for my bootcamp's final project!

Source of Dataset & Project Idea: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview

## Objective
Given a testing and training set, I will run NLP on a series of tweets to categorize their sentiments as bad, good, or neutral. I will then use the testing dataset to see how efficient the NLP classifier is from there and tune the algorithm.

## First Question - NLP
What words contribute to how a tweet's sentiment is classified?

## Second Question - Decision Tree
Given a testing set, where is a tweet likely to fall on a sentiment scale?
