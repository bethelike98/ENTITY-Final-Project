# Twitter Sentiment NLP Classifier
A repository containing my code and images for my bootcamp's final project!

Source of Dataset & Project Idea: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview

Objective: Given a testing and training set, I will run NLP on a series of tweets to categorize their sentiments as bad, good, or neutral. I will then use the testing dataset to see how efficient the NLP classifier is from there and tune the algorithm.
